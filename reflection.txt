While doing this task, I learned that many comments are unnecessary because they just repeat what the code already says. Such comments do not help and can actually make the code harder to read. I also learned that comments with names, dates, emotions, or vague statements are not useful. Good comments should explain why something is done, especially when the reason is not obvious from the code. Clean code relies more on clear logic and meaningful names, and less on comments.
